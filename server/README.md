Below is a (hopefully) comprehensive list of dependant software for the server
as well as the versions for said software

ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
Rails 4.2.6
gem 2.5.1
Bundler version 1.11.2

After you get the requisite software, you will also have to run 'bundle install
inside of the root directory of the server, and make sure you that you have all
of the appropriate gems also installed on your instance.
